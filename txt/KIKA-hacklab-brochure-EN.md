## WHAT THE HACK?

Hackerspaces or hacklabs exist all around the world. KIKA is one of them. It exists since the 17th October 2009.

## Why KIKA?

Learn new technologies and tech-related stuff, get help with Free and Open Source Software, hardware or electronics, learn about free culture, how to protect yourself and your rights, freely discuss all the topics you think about, work on and develop some of those ideas you keep in a box under your bed, drink all the coffee/tea/fruit you like, get guidance on local and global programmes like Google Summer of Code or GNOME Women Outreach, make new friends, host and attend events together, and have fun.
